# ch6celsiusTemperatures
Create a project that converts a Fahrenheit temperature to a Celsius temperature. The formula for this conversion is:

Celsius = 5 / 9 * (Fahrenheit - 32)

Use a function that accepts the Fahrenheit temperature as an argument and returns the Celsius temperature. Be sure to use floating point numbers for these temperatures, as it is quite normal to see values like 98.6 or 20.5 for temperatures.

Demonstrate the function by calling it in a loop that displays a table of Fahrenheit temperatures from 30 to 100 in increments of 5 (so 30, 35, 40, 45, etc.) with the Celsius equivalents. Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for each of those conversions, and compare your results to those test cases. Display the results with fixed precision of 2 decimal places, and always show those decimal places. Take a screenshot of the result of running the project.

Here is an example of temperatures from 0 to 30 in increments of 10, which is NOT what your table should include. See above for those details, look at this screenshot for how the table should display.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases, AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
